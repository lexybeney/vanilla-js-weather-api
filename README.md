# Vanilla JavaScript Weather App

## The task

This single page site was created as part of my software development course as an introduction to vanilla JavaScript.

It demonstrates my understanding of third-party APIs, the geolocator API and injecting dynamic content via JavaScript directly onto a page.

Visit my weather app [here](https://weatherapp.alexisbeney.co.uk).

## What I used

- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for API calls
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling
- [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for reverse geocoding
- [Geolocation API](https://github.com/w3c/geolocation-api) to get the user's location
